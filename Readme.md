# Coursera Developing Data Products Project Documentation

---

To run the application, please visit the following URL to access the app:
(https://laurao.shinyapps.io/developing_data_productsProject/)

The source code is located here - https://github.com/LauraOvesia/developing_data_productsProject

The sidebar on the left has 7 important input options that will allow the user to enter the data necessary to calculate the risk of having a heart attack in the next 10 years. 

Manipulating any of the options listed above will recalculate the prediction.

The prediction algorithm uses information from the Framingham Heart Study to predict a person's chance of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years.
More data about the Framingham Heart Study is available  here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Risk_Score

For this app we will use just a subset from the Framingham database, using just the most important columns that can influence the prediction results.

The substructure of the modified database used in this application is available in the Prediction Database Structure tab, and some sample values are available in the Prediction Database Head tab.
